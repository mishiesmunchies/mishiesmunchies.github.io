        Hi, my name is Michelle! 
        <br><br>
        I am a full-time registered nurse and owner of Mishie's Munchies! I made Mishie's Munchies as part of my dedication towards creating the most delicious vegan and dairy-free cinnamon rolls in Vancouver. My vision is to share cinnamon rolls that are just as good as the regular ones, but are also inclusive for food restrictions that some have. 
        <br><br>
        
        On this website, you will also find my blog which will give you insight into my experiences with baking and operating Mishie's Munchies so make sure to take a look! I hope that my cinnamon rolls make you as happy as they do for me and fill your day with sweetness ðŸ’–
