I"¦<p>You canâ€™t have a party without pizza! What better to bring to a potluck than Mini vegan pizza rolls?</p>

<p>I recently had a potluck with friends and brought these yummy rolls. Pizza rolls are such a great alternative to cinnamon rolls when you feel like eating something savory. These Mini pizza rolls are at the perfect size to enjoy the taste but also give you tummy space for the other dishes on the table.</p>
