        Hi, my name is Michelle! 

        I made Mishie's Munchies as part of my dedication towards creating and sharing the most delicious vegan and dairy-free cinnamon rolls in Vancouver. I am a full-time nurse and part-time Vancouver home baker! Baking is so therapeutic and a great way for me to relax after a long day of work. I love baking so I turned a hobby into something I can share with everyone! 
        <br /><br />
        Cinnamon rolls are one of my top 3 favourite desserts. Through trial and error I have created the perfect soft and fluffy cinnamon roll! My vision is to make it enjoyable for everyone so I made it  vegan and dairy free! I am currently working on creating new flavours so stay tuned on my announcement page. Also comment down below if you have any flavours you are interested in trying! I hope my cinnamon rolls can warm your hearts and fill your day with sweetness &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
