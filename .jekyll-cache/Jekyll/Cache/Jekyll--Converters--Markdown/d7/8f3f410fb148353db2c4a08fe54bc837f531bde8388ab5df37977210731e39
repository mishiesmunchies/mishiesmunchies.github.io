I"Y<p>This week, I purchased a new 6 quart KitchenAid stand mixer from Costco! It was on sale for $320 from $400 and I couldnâ€™t resist the temptation to upgrade my equipment and have a stand mixer that could make more rolls at a time!</p>

<p>Once I use it for a few more times, I will write how I feel about it in a future blog. Stay tuned!</p>
