        Hi, my name is Michelle! 
        <br /><br />
        I made Mishie's Munchies as part of my dedication towards creating and sharing the most delicious vegan and dairy-free cinnamon rolls in Vancouver. Outside of my part-time baking hobbies, I am a full-time registered nurse and I find it extremely rewarding to support my patients and promoting health and well-being.
        <br /><br />
        Cinnamon rolls are one of my top 3 favourite desserts. With inclusivity in mind, I set out to create a vegan and dairy-free cinnamon roll that My vision is to make it enjoyable for everyone so I made it  vegan and dairy free! I am currently working on creating new flavours so stay tuned on my announcement page. Also comment down below if you have any flavours you are interested in trying! I hope my cinnamon rolls can warm your hearts and fill your day with sweetness &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
