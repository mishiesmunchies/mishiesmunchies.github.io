I"S<p>This week, I purchased a new 6 quart KitchenAid stand mixer from Costco! It was on sale for $320 from $400 and I couldnâ€™t resist the temptation to upgrade my equipment and have a stand mixer that could make more rolls at a time!</p>

<p>Once I get to use it for a few more times, I will write how I feel about it in future blogs.</p>
