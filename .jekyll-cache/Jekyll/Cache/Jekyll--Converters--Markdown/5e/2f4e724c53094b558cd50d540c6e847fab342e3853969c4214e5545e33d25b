        Hi, my name is Michelle! 
        <br /><br />
        I made Mishie's Munchies as part of my dedication towards creating the most delicious vegan and dairy-free cinnamon rolls in Vancouver. My vision is to share cinnamon rolls that are just as good as the regular ones, but are also inclusive for food restrictions that some may have. 
        <br /><br />
        
        On this website, you will also find my blog which will give you insight into my experiences with baking and running Mishie's Munchies, and 

        I am currently working on creating new flavours so stay tuned on my announcement page. Also comment down below if you have any flavours you are interested in trying! I hope my cinnamon rolls can warm your hearts and fill your day with sweetness &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3

        Outside of my part-time baking hobbies, I am a full-time registered nurse and I find it extremely rewarding to support my patients and promoting health and well-being.
