I"{<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
And in css:

table {border: none;}
EDIT: As iGEL noted, this solution is officially deprecated (still works though), so if you are starting from scratch, you should go with the jnpcl's border-collapse solution.

I actually quite dislike this change so far (don't work with tables that often). It makes some tasks bit more complicated. E.g. when you want to include two different borders in same place (visually), while one being TOP for one row, and second being BOTTOM for other row. They will collapse (= only one of them will be shown). Then you have to study how is border's "priority" calculated and what border styles are "stronger" (double vs. solid etc.).

I did like this:

<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td class="first">first row</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="second">second row</td>
  </tr>
</table>
