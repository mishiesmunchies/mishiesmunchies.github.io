        Hi, my name is Michelle! 
        <br /><br />
        I made Mishie's Munchies as part of my dedication towards creating and sharing the most delicious vegan and dairy-free cinnamon rolls in Vancouver. My cinnamon rolls are just as good as regular cinnamon rolls but also are inclusive for food restrictions that some may have. 

        Share it with those who
        <br /><br />
        
        My vision is to make it enjoyable for everyone so I made it  vegan and dairy free! I am currently working on creating new flavours so stay tuned on my announcement page. Also comment down below if you have any flavours you are interested in trying! I hope my cinnamon rolls can warm your hearts and fill your day with sweetness &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3

        Outside of my part-time baking hobbies, I am a full-time registered nurse and I find it extremely rewarding to support my patients and promoting health and well-being.
