I"Ñ<p>You canâ€™t have a party without pizza! What better to bring to a potluck than Mini vegan pizza rolls?</p>

<p>I brought these yummy rolls to a potluck with friends recently. Pizza rolls are such a great alternative to cinnamon rolls when you donâ€™t feel like eating something savory.</p>

<p>These pizza mini rolls at a cute size so that you still have space for the other dishes on the table.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m thinking of adding vegan cheese to these rolls.</p>
