I"/<p>You can’t have a party without pizza! What better to bring to a potluck than Mini vegan pizza rolls?</p>

<p>I brought these yummy rolls to a potluck with friends recently. Pizza rolls are such a great alternative to cinnamon rolls when you don’t feel like eating something savory. These Mini pizza rolls are at the perfect size to enjoy the taste but also give you space</p>

<p>These pizza mini rolls are at a cute size so that you still have space for the other dishes on the table.</p>

<p>I’m thinking of adding vegan cheese to these rolls.</p>
