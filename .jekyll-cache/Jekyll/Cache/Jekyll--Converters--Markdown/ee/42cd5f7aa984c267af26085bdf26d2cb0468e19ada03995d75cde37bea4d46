I"O<p>You canâ€™t have a party without pizza! What better to bring to a potluck than Mini vegan pizza rolls?</p>

<p>I recently had a potluck with friends and brought these yummy rolls. You can see how cute these rolls look even before they are Pizza rolls are such a great alternative to cinnamon rolls when you feel like eating something savory. These Mini pizza rolls are at the perfect size to enjoy the taste but also give you tummy space for the other dishes on the table.</p>

<p>I think adding vegan cheese on top would give it a better appearance for next time. What do you think?</p>
