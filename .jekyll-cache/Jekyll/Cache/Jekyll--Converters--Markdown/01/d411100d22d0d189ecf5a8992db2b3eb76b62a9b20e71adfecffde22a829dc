I"m<p>You canâ€™t have a party without pizza! I had a potluck with friends and made mini vegan pizza rolls! Everyone enjoyed it and requested I make a version with cheese! That sounds like an exciting addition so I am considering it. These mini rolls are a perfect appetizer and are a good size to not make you full but leave your tummy with room for other foods.</p>
