Throwback to my weekend camping trip at Porteau Cove this year! My campsite had absolutely gorgeous views right next to the ocean. And of course, I brought along some cinnamon rolls to enjoy as I watched the sunset.

The Porteau Cove Campground is open all year round so make sure to check it out if you have the chance! <https://bcparks.ca/explore/parkpgs/porteau/>

Obligatory "Cake By The Ocean" by DNCE. Such a catchy song!
